## General Information
The project addresses the decline in revenues faced by the bike-sharing provider BoomBikes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. BoomBikes wants to comprehend the variables impacting the demand for shared bikes in the American market post-quarantine. The goal is to prepare a predictive model to help the management understand demand dynamics and plan business strategies accordingly.

The dataset used contains information on daily bike demands across the American market, considering various factors including meteorological surveys and people's behaviors.



## Conclusions
- dentification of significant variables influencing bike demand.
- Understanding of how well these variables describe the bike demands.
- Insights into demand dynamics for shared bikes in the American market.
